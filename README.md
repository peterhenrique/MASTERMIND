# MASTERMIND
Here I'll apply OOP to create a simple mastermind game.
This is a code-breaker game, in here you will have to select from valid colours and try to crack the code'
'You will have four rounds to crack the code'
'After each round, you will see the result of your guessing.'
"If you get a '●' it means you've got the right colour on the right spot"
"If you get a '◑' it means you've got the right colour on the wrong spot, and that the colour should go to the right"
"If you get a '◐' it means you've got the right colour on the wrong spot, and that the colour should go to the left"
"If you get a '○' it means you've got a wrong colour"
'good luck'
